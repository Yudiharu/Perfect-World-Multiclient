# Perfect-World-Multiclient
Simple apps build with java to open Perfect World online games multiple client.

How to use:<br>
Just publish the jar into exe and put it in your 'element' folder inside <b>Perfect World</b> folder.<br>
Currently i've set it using Combo box, last time based on my characters which is only 4.<br>
It can be changed into textbox to allow free input number but it wouldn't be wise to do that.
